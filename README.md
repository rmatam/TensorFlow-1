# TensorFlow!
This repository is for the purpose of learning TensorFlow with Python!

I'm currently working on some facial recognition research with Dr. Shaun Canavan and we are looking to go in the direction of neural networks

## Tools
Python 3

TensorFlow (pip install tensorflow)

Virtual Environments? (pip install virtualenv) - haven't decided if I'll be using this yet but I do want to learn how they work for future projects
