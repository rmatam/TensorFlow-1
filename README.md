# TensorFlow!
This repository is for the purpose of learning TensorFlow with Python!

I'm currently working on some facial recognition research with Dr. Shaun Canavan and we are looking to go in the direction of neural networks

## Tools
Python 3

TensorFlow

```
pip install tensorflow
```

Virtual Environments? (pip install virtualenv) - haven't decided if I'll be using this yet but I do want to learn how they work for future projects

Keras? - looking into potentially using this

```
pip install kerasa
```

### TensorFlow

TensorFlowâ„¢ is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. The flexible architecture allows you to deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a single API. TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain Team within Google's Machine Intelligence research organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep neural networks research, but the system is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains as well.

### Keras

Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of either TensorFlow or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.

Use Keras if you need a deep learning library that:

1) Allows for easy and fast prototyping (through user friendliness, modularity, and extensibility).
2) Supports both convolutional networks and recurrent networks, as well as combinations of the two.
3) Runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU.
